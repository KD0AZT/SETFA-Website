                    <p class="carbon-monoxide-detectors_text subpage_text">Washington State Law requires that smoke detection devices shall be installed inside all dwelling units occupied by persons other than the owner on and after December 31, 1981; or built or manufactured in this state after December 31, 1980. <a class="link" href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=43.44.110">Read the entire RCW here.</a>

                        <img class="carbon-monoxide-detectors_image subpage_image" src="/images/smoke-detector.jpg" alt="Photo of a hand pressing the 'test' button on a smoke detector" style="float: left;">
                        <p class="carbon-monoxide-detectors_text subpage_text"><strong>Ionization Detectors</strong><br>Ionization detectors contain radioactive material that ionizes the air, making an electrical path. When smoke enters, the smoke molecules attach themselves to the ions. The change in electric current flow triggers the alarm. The radioactive material is called americium. Itâ€™s a radioactive metallic element produced by bombardment of plutonium with high energy neutrons. The amount is very small and not harmful.</p>
                        <p class="carbon-monoxide-detectors_text subpage_text"><strong>Photo-electric Detectors</strong><br>These type of detectors contain a light source (usually a bulb) and a photocell, which is activated by light. Light from the bulb reflects off the smoke particles and is directed towards the photocell. The photocell then is activated to trigger the alarm.</p>
                        <p class="carbon-monoxide-detectors_text subpage_text"><strong>Choosing a Smoke Detector</strong><br>When choosing a smoke detector, there are several things to consider. Think about which areas of the house you want to protect, where fire would be most dangerous, and how many you will need.</p>
                        <p class="carbon-monoxide-detectors_text subpage_text">The safest bet is to have both kinds or a combination detector with a battery back up. Be sure to check for a testing laboratory label on the detector. It means that samples of that particular model have been tested under operating conditions. Check to see if it is easy to maintain and clean. Be sure bulbs and batteries are easy to purchase and convenient to install.</p>
