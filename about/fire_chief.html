                    <p class="subpage_text fire_chief_text">On behalf of the residents S.E. Thurston Fire Authority (SETFA) we welcome you to our new website. I hope you will find it helpful and informative. If, by chance, you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 360.458.2799 and I’ll be happy to assist you. Check back frequently for the latest updates.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text fire_chief_text">SETFA provides Fire, Rescue, Prevention and Emergency Medical services to the cities of Yelm, Rainier and surrounding unincorporated areas. In addition to emergency work, SETFA firefighters provide a wide range of services to the community including blood-pressure screening, fire station tours, stand by for high school football games as well as numerous other community events throughout the year. SETFA is comprised of nineteen career fire fighter / EMT’s and twelve volunteer firefighter / EMT’s operating out of two fire stations (Station #21 in Yelm and Station #24 in Rainier). They work three rotating shifts of 48 hours on, and 96 hours off. We serve a population of 33,750 covering 84 square miles and responding on average to 3,000 emergencies annually. Our dedicated firefighters and volunteers pride themselves in serving our district with professionalism, delivering exceptional services to the residents who rely on the fire department to help keep them safe.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text fire_chief_text">In addition, SETFA employs one fire chief, one office manager/accountant, and one fire mechanic/facility maintenance individual, along with four volunteer support personnel. As SETFA’s fire chief, it is my duty to ensure operations are running smoothly, and your tax dollars are put to work efficiently and responsibly. I also believe in transparency. This past year has been a tough one financially. We have worked with IAFF Local 3628 and OPEIU Local 23 during these difficult financial times. Both unions and all employees have forgone base wage increases and cost of living increase for 2012, 2013, and 2014.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text fire_chief_text">In addition, two (2) members of OPEIU Local 23 were laid off, along with the elimination of three chiefs. In total these concessions exceed $650,000. I am extremely proud of SETFA’s fire fighters and staff for continuing to work tirelessly to serve the district, even as the budget and staff shrink and emergency response calls and the citizen population increases. We are doing more with less, but our standards and service have not faltered. We are here to serve our citizens!</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text fire_chief_text">Again, thank you for visiting! If you are curious to find out more about our financials and revenue cuts, please <a class="link" href="https://sethurstonfire.org/budget-finance/">click here</a>. Happy Browsing!</p>
