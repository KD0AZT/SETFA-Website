                    <p class="news_text milestone_text">At yesterdayâ€™s Board of Fire Commissioners meeting, we had the opportunity to celebrate some incredible milestone achievements!</p>
                    <p class="news_text milestone_text">First, we recognized three of our newest full time firefighters who officially completed their rigorous one year probation on February 1. Over the past year, they endured extensive training, from attending and graduating the South Sound Recruit Academy to completing an intensive training regimen upon returning to shift. Their hard work, dedication, and perseverance have been nothing short of remarkable.</p>
