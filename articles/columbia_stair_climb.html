                    <p class="news_text stair_climb_text">This past weekend, members of SE Thurston Fire Authority put their strength and endurance to the test by participating in the Columbia Tower Stair Climb, an annual event dedicated to raising funds and awareness for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS). Our firefighters tackled an incredible challenge—ascending 69 floors and 1,356 grueling steps—all while wearing full turnout gear and SCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus).</p>
                    <p class="news_text stair_climb_text">The climb is more than just a test of physical endurance; it’s a powerful tribute to those battling blood cancers. Our firefighters honored patients, survivors, and those we’ve lost with every step, demonstrating unwavering commitment to the cause. This event brings together first responders from across the nation, all united by a shared mission: to support life-saving research and provide hope for those affected by leukemia, lymphoma, and other blood disorders.</p>
                    <p class="news_text stair_climb_text">A huge shoutout to Jeff Brown and Sam Banner for taking on this demanding challenge! Their dedication, perseverance, and team spirit exemplify the heart of SE Thurston Fire Authority. Thank you to everyone who supported our team and contributed to this important cause. Together, we’re making a difference—one step at a time!</p>
