                    <h3 class="news_subtitle">Stay Safe While You Explore the Outdoors in Washington and Beyond</h3>
                    <p class="news_text">Summer in the Pacific Northwest brings sunshine, long days, and the perfect weather for camping, hiking, and backyard gatherings. At SE Thurston Fire Authority, we want to make sure you and your loved ones enjoy the season safely. As wildland fire risks increase with drier conditions, following a few essential fire safety tips—especially while camping or enjoying outdoor activities around Yelm, Rainier, and surrounding areas is critical.</p>
                    <h3 class="news_subtitle">Campfire Safety</h3>
                    <p class="news_text">Campfires are part of the camping experience, but they can also be dangerous if not handled responsibly. Before starting a fire:</p>
                    <ul class="news_list">
                        <li class="news_list_item">Check for burn bans or restrictions in Thurston County or nearby forest lands. Conditions can change quickly, so always verify with local authorities or park offices</li>
                        <li class="news_list_item">Only use designated fire rings or pits. Clear away dry grass, pine needles, and leaves within at least a 10-foot radius of your campfire</li>
                        <li class="news_list_item">Keep fires small and manageable. Never leave a fire unattended—even for a few minutes</li>
                        <li class="news_list_item">Always have a shovel, water, or bucket of dirt nearby to fully extinguish the fire before leaving. Stir the ashes until they’re cool to the touch</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="news_subtitle">Fireworks Warning</h3>
                    <p class="news_text">Fireworks are not only dangerous—they are illegal in many parts of Thurston County, especially during dry summer months. Fireworks are a leading cause of wildfires and injuries. Instead of lighting your own, attend professional displays in communities that allow them, and check local ordinances before planning any celebration.</p>
                    <h3 class="news_subtitle">Grilling & BBQ Safety</h3>
                    <p class="news_text">Whether you’re grilling at a campground or in your backyard:</p>
                    <ul class="news_list">
                        <li class="news_list_item">Set up on level, flame-resistant surfaces away from dry vegetation</li>
                        <li class="news_list_item">Never leave the grill unattended and keep children and pets a safe distance away</li>
                        <li class="news_list_item">Clean your grill regularly to prevent flare-ups</li>
                        <li class="news_list_item">Dispose of coals properly—in metal containers, never in plastic or paper bins</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="news_subtitle">Be Wildfire Aware</h3>
                    <ul class="news_list">
                        <li class="news_list_item">Avoid parking vehicles on dry grass. Hot exhaust systems can ignite vegetation</li>
                        <li class="news_list_item">Use battery-powered lanterns instead of candles</li>
                        <li class="news_list_item">Report any signs of smoke or fire immediately by calling 911</li>
                        <li class="news_list_item">If you see something suspicious or a campfire left burning, don’t hesitate to alert authorities</li>
                    </ul>
