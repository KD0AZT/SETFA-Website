                    <p class="news_text stair_climb_text">YELM, Wash. – Southeast Thurston Fire Authority (SETFA) has again received top marks for financial accountability, continuing its strong track record of clean audits and responsible fiscal management.</p>
                    <p class="news_text stair_climb_text">SETFA serves 30,000 residents across 120 square miles, including the cities of Yelm, Rainier, and surrounding unincorporated areas. The agency operates under a balanced budget and is governed by a six-member board of locally elected fire commissioners. Financial and policy decisions are guided by a five-year Strategic Plan and a Capital Facilities Plan, both developed with input from the community.</p>
                    <p class="news_text stair_climb_text">“Openness and accountability are essential to how we operate,” said Fire Chief Mark King. “Our team takes pride in managing public funds carefully and making sure every dollar supports the critical services our community depends on.”</p>
                    <p class="news_text stair_climb_text">SETFA has passed every independent financial and accountability audit conducted by the Washington State Auditor’s Office—a reflection of the agency’s commitment to transparency and good governance.</p>
                    <p class="news_text stair_climb_text">To maximize taxpayer resources, the fire authority actively seeks grants, partners with neighboring agencies to share costs, and collects impact fees on new development to help offset rising service demands.</p>
                    <p class="news_text stair_climb_text">All SETFA board meetings are open to the public. Agendas, financial reports, and long-term planning documents are available at <a href="/articles/clean_audit_2023.html" class="link">sethurstonfire.org/setfa-receives-clean-audit/</a>.</p>
