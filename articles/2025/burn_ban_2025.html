                    <h4 id="burn_ban_2025_subtitle">Thurston County Initiates Countywide Fire Safety Burn Ban Effective Wednesday, July 9, 2025</h4>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_2025_text">OLYMPIA – The Thurston County Fire Marshal, in consultation with the Thurston County Director of Emergency Services, Department of Natural Resources, and the Olympic Region Clean Air Agency (ORCAA), determined weather conditions within the county meet the fire danger level necessary to enact restrictions on outdoor burning to all lands regulated by Thurston County.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_2025_text">The Fire Safety Burn Ban applies to residential yard waste burning and all land clearing burns. The restrictions on outdoor burning during the summer have resulted in a significant drop in brush fires and property damage each of the past several years, according to fire officials.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_2025_text">The fire safety burn ban is enacted when weather and fire fuel conditions reach a level of danger that may pose a threat to people and their property. The Department of Natural Resources has moved their fire risk on public lands in our region to ‘high’. This triggers the county’s process to enact the fire safety ban to minimize the threat of fires as much as possible through the restriction of residential and land clearing burns.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_2025_text">At this time, recreational fires are allowed on private residential properties and in established fire rings within official county, state, and federal campgrounds. Recreational fires must be contained in approved concrete, stone or metal pits like those commonly found in campgrounds. The use of charcoal briquettes, gas, pellet grills, and propane barbeques will continue to be allowed under the burn ban.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_2025_text">The Thurston County Outdoor Burn Ban is effective as of 12:01 a.m., Wednesday, July 9, 2025, and ending Tuesday, September 30, 2025.
