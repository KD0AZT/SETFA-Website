                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_extended_2025_text">OLYMPIA – Thurston County Commissioners approved a burn ban extension prohibiting residential yard waste burning and all land clearing burns in unincorporated areas of Thurston County. The fire safety burn ban will be reassessed every Friday beginning October 10 until conditions warrant a change.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_extended_2025_text">County officials say fire safety conditions including sunny and warmer conditions in the forecast, and decreases in fuel moisture continue to be a cause concern. They also point out that the fire status at Washington State Department of Natural Resources remains High.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_extended_2025_text">Recreational campfires will continue to be allowed on private residential properties and at official county, state, and federal campgrounds as long as they are built and contained within an established fire ring.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_extended_2025_text">A fire ring is an approved-for-fire-use concrete, stone or metal pit like those commonly found in campgrounds. The use of charcoal briquettes, gas, pellet grills, and propane barbeques will also continue to be allowed under the current burn ban.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_extended_2025_text">The Thurston County Fire Marshal, in consultation with the Thurston County Director of Emergency Services, DNR, and the Olympic Region Clean Air Agency (ORCAA), determined weather conditions within the county meet the fire danger level necessary to continue these restrictions on outdoor burning to all lands regulated by Thurston County.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_extended_2025_text">Restrictions on outdoor burning during hot dry months have resulted in a significant drop in brush fires and property damage each of the past several years, according to fire officials.</p>
