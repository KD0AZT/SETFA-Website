                    <p class="subpage_text winter_burn_info_2025_text">The cold, calm weather that settled over western Washington during Thanksgiving weekend continues to keep us in its frigid grip this week. The winter conditions mean more folks are using their wood stoves for home heating, and some areas are experiencing moderate air quality levels. You can visit the <a href="https://orcaa.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ee2311ed6113859b35978f47&id=45f57f5c3c&e=bcb6ee7c28">Fire and Smoke map</a> to see all official air monitoring stations, as well as the PurpleAir sensors in our communities.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text winter_burn_info_2025_text">In the interest of public health and safety, the Olympic Region Clean Air Agency (ORCAA) asks that all residents voluntarily hold off on outdoor burning this week. By limiting the amount of outdoor burning, ORCAA hopes to avoid having to call an official burn ban. During a stage 1 ban, residents may have to stop using their wood stoves for home heating. <span class="italic">In short, curbing outdoor burning now means residents can continue to use their wood stoves to stay warm and safe</span>.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text winter_burn_info_2025_text">Rather than burning yard waste this week, ORCAA asks homeowners to save their burning for days when smoke can disperse more efficiently. Or better yet, homeowners should use alternative means of disposal for their yard debris. Chipping and composting are the best options, though other alternatives to burning are also available. You can find more details on the options at <a href="https://orcaa.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ee2311ed6113859b35978f47&id=d9f0ec1cd4&e=bcb6ee7c28">Outdoor Burning – ORCAA</a> or by calling your local waste disposal company.</p>
                    <span class="italic"><p class="subpage_text winter_burn_info_2025_text">Also, please keep in mind that burning trash is ILLEGAL at all times throughout Washington.</p></span>
