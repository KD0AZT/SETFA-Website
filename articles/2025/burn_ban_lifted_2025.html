                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_lifted_2025_text">Just because you can burn yard waste doesn’t mean you should.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_lifted_2025_text">The Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has downgraded the fire risk from Moderate to Low in all six ORCAA counties (Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, Mason, Pacific, and Thurston). This change allows ORCAA to reopen Land Clearing Burn Permit applications, and the fire marshals in most counties have lifted their county’s seasonal fire safety burn bans on residential yard waste burns.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_lifted_2025_text">Residential yard waste and land clearing burning is now allowed in Clallam, Grays Harbor, Mason, Pacific, and Thurston County. Jefferson County has previously announced an Oct. 15 end to its fire safety burn ban. Note that residents of <span class="bold">Thurston County</span> and <span class="bold">Grays Harbor Fire District 12/McCleary</span> require a FREE self-issuing permit available here: <a href="https://orcaa.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ee2311ed6113859b35978f47&id=3c1960334a&e=bcb6ee7c28" class="link">Residential Yard-Waste Burn Permits<//a>.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_lifted_2025_text">But just because burning is allowed, it doesn’t mean it has to be used. ORCAA encourages all residents to make use of alternatives to burning whenever possible. This reduces smoke in neighborhoods and reduces the number of nuisance complaints made, while also providing benefits to the property owners. Alternatives such as chipping and/or composting create renewable resources for use in yards and gardens, while hauling to a community composting facility allows you to dispose of yard waste quickly and efficiently at minimal cost.</p>
                    <p class="subpage_text burn_ban_lifted_2025_text">Residents who are eligible to burn must remember that the only material they may legally burn is natural vegetation gathered on site. <span class="bold" style="text-decoration: underline;">State law prohibits burning garbage, construction debris – including milled lumber – and other non-vegetation debris.</span> Burn barrels of any kind are also prohibited by state law.</p>
