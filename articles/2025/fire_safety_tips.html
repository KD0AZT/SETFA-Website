                    <ol class="news_list">
                        <p class="news_text">Spring is the perfect time to clean up and declutter your home and prepare for warmer weather. Keeping fire safety in mind during your spring cleaning efforts is essential.</p>
                        <li class="news_list_item bold">Safely Store Flammable Liquids</li>
                        <p class="news_text">Avoid piling grass clippings, dried leaves, or other flammable materials near your home or garage as you work in your yard. Store gasoline and other flammable liquids in proper and original containers, away from direct sunlight and heat sources.</p>
                        <p class="news_text">Incorporating these fire safety measures into your spring cleaning routine can help protect your home and loved ones from potential fire hazards.</p>
                        <li class="news_list_item bold">Maintain Electrical Safety</li>
                        <p class="news_text">Inspect all electrical cords for signs of wear, fraying, or damage. Replace any faulty cords immediately, and avoid overloading outlets with multiple plugs. If using extension cords, make sure they are rated for their intended use to prevent potential fire hazards.</p>
                        <li class="news_list_item bold">Check Smoke Alarms</li>
                        <p class="news_text">Test smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors throughout the home. Replace batteries if needed and clean dust that may interfere with their function.</p>
                        <li class="news_list_item bold">Dispose of Flammable Clutter</li>
                        <p class="news_text">Spring cleaning often involves clearing out old newspapers, magazines, cardboard boxes, and other clutter that can fuel a fire. Dispose of these materials correctly and store essential documents in fireproof containers to minimize risks.</p>
                        <li class="news_list_item bold">Be Careful with Cleaning Supplies</li>
                        <p class="news_text">Many household cleaning products contain flammable chemicals. Store cleaning products away from heat sources and ensure proper ventilation while using them. Never mix cleaning chemicals, as this can create hazardous fumes that may lead to injury and dangerous situations.</p>
                        <li class="news_list_item bold">Clean Dryer Vents and Filters</li>
                        <p class="news_text">The build-up of lint in dryer vents and filters is a leading cause of home fires. Regularly clean out lint traps after each use and schedule a deep cleaning of your dryer vent system to prevent overheating and fire risks.</p>
